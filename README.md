## How It Works

1. **User enters a game name** in the search bar.
2. The **frontend** sends the query to the **Django backend** (`/search_games` endpoint).
3. Django **fetches data** from the RAWG API using Python’s `requests` module.
4. The backend **filters and sends JSON** results to the frontend.
5. **JavaScript** dynamically updates the page with game cards and info.
